## What is 5XA❓️

5XA is an organization formed by a bunch of folks whose names all start with the letter "A." We thought, "Why not make it a thing?" So, here we are, making open-source magic happen! We believe in the power of collaboration, creativity, and just a dash of "A"-mazing ideas. Our goal is to create impactful open-source projects that bring value to the community, all while having a blast!

## Who are we? 😎

We’re a bunch of budding minds who spend more time in hackathons than in our own beds! 🛌💻 We've taken part in multiple hackathons, and guess what? We’ve even bagged a few wins! 🏆 (Yes, we did it while running on caffeine, questionable amounts of snacks, and the occasional “I’ll just take a 5-minute break” that turned into a 3-hour nap).

Our motto? If it’s a hackathon, we’re in. If it’s something we can contribute to, we're in. If there’s a chance to make something cool—yep, you guessed it—we're definitely in! We love contributing, collaborating, and creating fun, impactful stuff that makes the world a little better (or at least a little more interesting).

## Meet the 5XA Crew 😎

  <b>Aksshay (The Human Joke)</b> – Aksshay isn’t the one cracking jokes—he is the joke. When he’s not being the punchline, he’s debugging code at the speed of his snarky comebacks. Need advice? Don’t ask him unless you're prepared for some answers that are more fun than functional. 😜

 <b>Abhishek Renjan (The Portion Master) </b>– Abhishek's superpower? He can calculate the exact amount of food for every situation, just like he calculates time complexity for algorithms. Whether it’s snacks or pizza, he ensures the "perfect portion" of both food and code, avoiding any unnecessary bloat. 🍕

<b>Aakash (The Greek Mind)</b> – Aakash brings the brainpower of a philosopher and the wisdom of an ancient Greek mathematician... but with more code and fewer scrolls. Need a complex algorithm optimized? He’s the one to ask. Need a meme for the bug you just fixed? Also him. 🧠

<b>Aswin (The Police for a Reason)</b> – Aswin’s the self-appointed "law enforcement" of the team. He ensures the rules of clean code are followed and that no bugs slip by unnoticed. If the code gets messy, you can bet he’ll be there to refactor it. Deadlines beware—Aswin’s watchful eye is always on the clock. 👮‍♂️

<b>Akash A (The Enigma)</b> – Akash A is like the mysterious person in the codebase that no one fully understands, but everyone relies on. He works in the background, optimizing performance and solving problems with a quiet efficiency that leaves everyone else in awe  🤫
